To solve this, carefully examine your `package.json` file and check the compatibility of all your third-party libraries with your current React Native version. Consider using tools like `react-native-version-manager` to manage React Native versions and to ensure compatibility. If you are using native modules, make sure they are compatible with your target platforms (iOS and Android) and are correctly linked. In some cases, updating to the latest versions of the problematic libraries may resolve the issue. If updating isn't possible, you may need to explore alternative libraries or seek support from the library's community.
